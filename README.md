## nanobox-docker-mongodb ![Build Status Image](https://travis-ci.org/nanobox-io/nanobox-docker-mongodb.svg)

This repo contains the files necessary to create the mongodb docker image for [Nanobox](http://nanobox.io) consumption.

#### Requirements

* [vagrant](vagrantup.com)
* [dockerhub](hub.docker.com) account

## Usage

#### Vagrant

Before building docker containers, we must initialize the virtual machine with vagrant:

```bash
vagrant up
```

#### Build

To build the image:

```bash
make build
```

#### Publish

To publish the image:

```bash
make publish
```

To publish the image tagged as alpha:

```bash
make publish stability=alpha
```

#### Combo

To build and publish the image:

```bash
make
```

To build and publish the image tagged as alpha:

```bash
make stability=alpha
```

#### Cleaning

To remove all images from the Vagrant machine:

```bash
make clean
```

## Testing

All changes, experimental or not, should be published using the alpha tag. The alpha image can be tested by using [Nanobox](http://nanobox.io), and adding the following to an application's Boxfile:

```yaml
web1:
  stability: alpha
```

## Caveat

#### Authentication

If during a publish, you receive the error:

```bash
unauthorized: access to the requested resource is not authorized
```

Run the following command and follow the login prompt:

```bash
make login
```

Subsequent publishes will use a stored api token.

#### Cleanup

Don't forget to halt the Vagrant machine when you're done:

```bash
vagrant halt
```
